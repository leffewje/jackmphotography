	<h1>About Your Photographer</h1>
	<p id="content">Jack McLoughlin has been behind a camera since he was 6 years old.  He was born in the beautiful hills of Ireland
and moved with his family to America for schooling.  He practiced with photography throughout his school years until college
where he studied digital arts and photography.  In 2009, Jack graduated from California Institute of the Arts with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Digital Arts
before moving to Tampa Bay.  There he was awarded several local awards for his photographic works from publishers such as the Tampa Bay Times.<br /><br />
Jack's desire is to bring happiness to peoples' lives by capturing precious memories and immortalizing them for his clients to
enjoy.  Jack enjoys hiking, enjoying nature and relaxing at the beach when not behind the camera.</p>
